        <h1>Welcome to the Python Projects Page</h1>
        <p>We make coding content to show what’s happening behind the scenes in electronics...</p>

        <section class="code-section">
            <p>Python is a coding language used to make <b>programs (apps)</b>. To print (write):</p>
            <code>print('hello')</code>

            <p><br>To make an input (ask), there are two ways:</p>
            <p><b>Way number one:</b></p>
            <code>input("What is your name?")</code>
            <p><b>This way can't be used in an if statement</b></p>

            <p><b>Way number two:</b></p>
            <code>i = input("What is your name?")</code>
            <p><b>This way can be used in an if statement</b></p>

            <p>Talking about if statements, here's how to write one:</p>
            <pre>
i = int(input("How old are you? "))
if i >= 18:
    print("You fit in our company terms and conditions!")
else:
    print("You don't fit in our company's terms and conditions, so you can't create an account!")
            </pre>
        </section>

        <h2>Data types</h2>
        <span>
            <b>To write a string (str), which means text values:</b><br>
            name = "Ali"<br>
            age = "15"<br>
            print(name)<br>
            print(age)<br>
            (The name you put before the equal sign is called a variable, and you can name it anything as long as you haven't used that exact name before in the same scope.)<br>
            is_student = "True"
            <b>To write Integers (negative and positive numbers) write:</b><br>
            number_of_students = 10<br>
            speed = -120<br>
            print(number_of_students)<br>
            print(speed)<br>
            <b>How to write float (A number with decimals)</b><br>
            GPA = 3.5<br>
            bill = round(15.329, 2)<br>
            print(bill)<br>

            print(is_player)<br>
            print(is_footballer)<br>
            (The **hash symbol (#)** means the code following it is a comment, so the interpreter ignores it and it won't be seen when your app runs.)
            <b>If you don't want to change its value (True or False) then write:</b><br>
            is_player = True <br>
            #or is_footballer = False<br>

            print(28/4)<br>
            #only use the slash sign<br>

            print(24%7)<br>
            <b>To use comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) write:</b><br>

            print(1 >= 2)<br>
            print(1 <= 2)<br>
            ("==" means equal to, "!=" means not equal to, ">" means greater than, "<" means less than, ">=" means greater than or equal to, and "<=" means less than or equal to.)
