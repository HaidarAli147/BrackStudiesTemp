    <h1>Welcome to the Python Projects Page</h1>
    <p>We make coding content to show what’s happening behind the scenes in electronics...</p>

    <section class="code-section">
      <p>Python is a coding language used to make <b>programs (apps)</b>. To print (write):</p>
      <code>print('hello')</code>

      <p><br>To make an input (ask), there are two ways:</p>
      <p><b>Way number one:</b></p>
      <code>input("What is your name?")</code>
      <p><b>This way can't be used in an if statement</b></p>

      <p><b>Way number two:</b></p>
      <code>i = input("What is your name?")</code>
      <p><b>This way can be used in an if statement</b></p>

      <p>Talking about if statements, here's how to write one:</p>
      <pre>
i = int(input("How old are you? "))
if i >= 18:
    print("You fit in our company terms and conditions!")
else:
    print("You don't fit in our company's terms and conditions, so you can't create an account!")
      </pre>
    </section>

    <h2>Data types</h2>
    <span>
<b>To write string (str) which means text values:</b><br>
name = "Ali"</br>
age = "15"</br>
print(name)</br>
print(age)</br>
(the name you put before the equal is called variables, and you can amke it any thing unless you used it before in the same file.)</br>
is_student = "True"
<b>To write Integers (negitive and possitive numbers) write:</br>
number_of_students = 10</br>
speed = -120</br>
print(number_of_students)</br>
print(speed)</br>
  <b>How to write float (A number with decimals)</b><br>
  GPA = 3.5<br>
bill = round(15.329, 2)<br>
print(bill)<br>
print(GPA)<br>
<b>If you want to write a Boolean(which means True or false) write:</b><br>
is_player = True <br>#or is_footballer = False<br>
print(is_player)<br>
print(is_footballer)<br>
(hashtage means the code can't read it so it won't be seen on your app)
  <B> If you don't wan't to change it's value (True or false) then write:</B><br>
  is_player = True  <br>
 #or is_footballer = False<br>
  print(not is_player)
  print(not is_footballer)
    </span>

    <p>
     <b></b>To make addiion, write:</b><br>
    print(2+2)<br>
    #warning do not add equal sign!<br>
    <b>To do subtraction, write:</b><br>
    print(10-6)<br>
    <b>To do multiplitcation, write:</b><br>
    (9*9)<br>
    #warning if you use the leter x insted of the * it won't work.<br>
    <b>Division</b><br>
    print(28/4)<br>
    #only use the slash sign<br>
    <b>To do a Modulo, which means to ask what is the remainder of the number, write:</b><br>
    print(24%7)<br>
    <b>to make  some comparison operators, "<" ">"=" "!=" ">=" "<="  "<" means less than ">"  means greater than  "=" means equal to "!=" means not equal to ">=" means greater than and equal to "<=" means less than and equal to, write:</b><br>
      print(1 == 1)<br>

print(1 > 2)<br>
print(1 < 2)<br>
print(1 >= 2)<br>
